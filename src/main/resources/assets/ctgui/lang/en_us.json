In the changed recipe list you have an overview of all changes you made and can export them to CraftTweaker. It is currently not possible to edit existing recipe changes. Also note that tags are a bit special in contrast to other recipe types. If you edit an existing tag the contents get locked that means if you would add a new mod that adds items to the tag it would not be updated. To mitigate this you can create a new tag with the same name, this will add the items to the existing tag. You also have to do this if you want to edit tags with 1 or 0 items as emi does not display those. Also note that emi collapses tags with one item normally. This is disabled in the editing menu, so if you make a recipe with a tag that contains only one item the recipe will look like it is accepting just that item not the tag in emi. You can disable the edit mode warning message in the config.",
